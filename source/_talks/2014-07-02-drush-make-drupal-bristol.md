At the [Drupal Association](https://assoc.drupal.org), we use [Drush Make](http://www.drush.org/en/master/make/) to manage all of our codebases for Drupal.org and it’s subsites.

This talk will cover:

* What is Drush, and what is Drush Make.
* How to install Drush Make (if you’re using an old version of Drush).
* How to write a Drush Make file.
  * Which version of Drupal core?
  * Adding contrib modules, including development releases.
  * Including custom modules from external sources.
  * Adding themes and libraries.
  * How to automatically apply patches.
  * Including other Drush Make files.
* Once you’ve written a Drush Make, how to use it and generate a site.
* How to generate a Drush Make for an existing Drupal site.
